							<p>
							Sogie Bill is a bill that yearns to make the rights of cis and non-cis people’s rights equal. It is to prevent unfair choices 
							against marginalized sectors and in this case, the LGBTQIA+ community. Unfair choices in this context means that people 
							will have a certain bias against people who have different SOGIE from other than their own preferences.

								<h3>The Fight Against Discrimination</h3>
								<p>
								Imagine being a gay person with a college degree. You want to apply to a certain company and your co-applicant 
								is a cisgender who only has a highschool diploma and they chose the cisgendered person. Isn’t it unfair for people
								to be discriminated against just for the way they want to live?

								<h3>Rage Against Violence</h3>
								<p>
								There are also cases of people getting hurt or worse, dying just because of the way they want to present themselves. 
								The lives of these people were ended just because of a single person who didn’t like the way they chose to live. 
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
								Catcalling or judging a person on the way they look would also be illegal if the bill were to be passed. 
								People would now be comfortable with the way they want to look.

						<div class="content">
							<h4>What about the rights of straight people?</h4>
							<p>
							SOGIE Bill isn’t just for non-binary people, it also includes rights for binary people.
							Also, SOGIE Bill isn’t aiming for a country where non-binary people are dominant. It just aims for a country 
							where everyone is equal and everybody is free. People just think that this bill is unfair because their mindset 
							is fixed on the current society where males are dominant.
							</p>
							<br>
							<h4>In the Bible, it is said that people who like people of the same sex are damned.</h4>
							<p>Even though our country is dominated by people who believe in Christ, not everyone is a believer 
							so it would be unfair for them if they were not able to express their opinions. The bill wouldn’t also directly 
							affect them because it doesn’t say that they can’t practice their religion after the bill is passed. Most importantly,
							the church shouldn’t have a say on politics. It was stated in the constitution of 1987 that the church and the state should be 
							separated and in exchange, discrimination against practicing a specific religion is illegal.
