								<h3>Sexual Orientation</h3>
								<p>
									According to the American Psychological Association, sexual orientation “refers to an enduring pattern 
									of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes”. From reasearch throughout many decades, 
									it was shown that sexual orientation exists along a continuum, from exclusive attraction to the other sex 
									to exclusive attraction to the same sex. People who are attracted to people of the same gender are said to be heterosexual, 
									those who are attracted to the opposite gender are homosexual, those attracted to both sexes have a bisexual orientation, 
									and a person who feels no sexual attraction at all is called asexual. This range of behaviors and attractions has been described 
									in various cultures among countries.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									The aspect of sexual orientation is more than just sexual behaviour. It may also include feelings as well as identity. 
									Sexual orientation is not fixed; it may develop through a person’s lifetime. Individuals may become aware that they are heterosexual, 
									gay, lesbian, or bisexual at different points of their lives.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									Sexual orientation is different from other components of sex and gender. It is distinct from biological sex 
									(which are the anatomical, physiological, and genetic characteristics associated with being a male or female), gender identity 
									(the innate sense of identifying as a male or female, and social geder role (which is the norms that define masculine and feminine behaviour, 
									which may vary through cultures).

								<h3>Gender Identity</h3>
								<p>
									Gender identity is one’s innate sense of being male, female, both, or neither. Gender identity involves 
									more than the physical aspect of a person, it involves one’s knowledge of his or her own identity. A person’s gender 
									identity could be the same or could be different from one’s assigned gender at birth. Gender identity is a product of 
									combined internal and external factors that affect the person. Gender identity is distinct from gender role because for example,
									if a person considers herself a female and is most comfortable referring to her gender as female, that person 
									identifies her gender as female. However, that person’s gender role is only female is she practices typically 
									feminine characteristics, which are defined and considered appropriate by the culture that person is in.
								</p>

								<h3>Gender Expression</h3>
								<p>
									Gender expression is how a person outwardly shows their gender identity through how he or she behaves. 
									Gender roles are included under gender expression. Some examples of gender expression are feminine, masculine, and androgynous.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									Gender expression does not always match a person’s gender identity. For example, a person who was assigned male at birth 
									may identify as female, but is restricted because of social conditions that prohibits that person from expressing her true identity. 
									Because of this, this person continues to express herself as male.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									Gender expression is not fixed and may or may not change in a person’s lifetime. It may also change based on other circumstances 
									like a person’s mood. For example, a male might normally wear men’s clothes and have masculine behaviour and mannerisms. 
									However, that same person may change how he expresses himself by wearing a wig and high heels when he feels like it.
